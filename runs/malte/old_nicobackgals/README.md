Experiments with contamination of stamps by faint, detectable and undetectable "background" galaxies.
Working on this with Nicolas, Fall 2016
Led to some bad conditional biases, probably did never really converge.


Switching to MultNet and Tenbilac config file interface in Jan 2017


train_Nico4nn_g1ada5_sum55
had just 4 features.
4e-6

train_Nico4nn_g1ada5_sum55really5
idem with 5 featuers
actually slightly worse
g2 not needed at this point, it's often killed


train_Nico4nn_g1ada5_mult55
4 feat, no optimization of mult layer
converges on different levels (depending on mult layer noise), but all bad. 1e-5



train_Nico4nn_g1ada5_mult55free
4 inputs

seems way too powerful

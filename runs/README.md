About
=====

This is a place to keep actual scripts and settings to run stuff.

To use it without interfering with the megalut package development (e.g., despite switching branches for the main code), you might want to **clone a second copy** of the megalut repo on your system without adding it to your pythonpath, keep this second copy on the master branch, and run/modify scripts within this second copy.


Contents
--------

- **demo**: scripts testing and demonstrating parts of megalut. 
- **great3**: latest application to GREAT3, using the megalutgreat3 wrapper, should evolve into the scripts that we release together with the paper.
- **malte**: Runs and scripts by Malte, see included README.

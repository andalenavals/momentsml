### Further stuff

This might be a bit outdated, but could still be useful.

- **convention_stamp** : a fits stamp to test the adopted coordinate conventions
- **generic** : scripts to test some of the MomentsML tools
- **snr_study** : checks half-light radius of profiles (Nov 2017)
- **profile_hlr_study** : numerical sigma-hlr relation (Nov 2017)
- **simple**: Run on simple simulations for machine learning development. No "Run"-Class, just hard-coded calls to momentsml functions (2016), to make code development easy.

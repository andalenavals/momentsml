========

Not a euclid-sized Gaussian PSF, but more a "ground-based" situation, to demonstrate PSF correction clearly.
Sky-limited observations with Gaussian noise
Mostly "uniform" distributions


Simulations
-----------

Dataset categories:

  * si : "simulation inspection" : a simple set of galaxies drawn from the parameter distributions, to test feature measurements etc.
  * ts : "train shear" : cases contain always the same galaxy, rotated on a ring
  * vs : "validate shear" : same structure as ts, to probe (conditional) biases of the shear point estimate (without weights)
  * tw : "train weights" : cases contain different galaxies, no SNC.
  * vo : "validate overall" : cases contain different galaxies (potentially with SNC) 


We have several configurations for each category:


ts-1
ts-2 : (tbd)

vs-1
vs-2
vs-3 : 50 Mgal, 


vo-1
vo-2 : 20 Mgal, 383 GB

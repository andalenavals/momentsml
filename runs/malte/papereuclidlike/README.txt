- train w with SNC
	(and still test without): does this improve things ?
	trainings on tw-1-snc are running, to see. It might lower the amplitude of the selection effect, as low-snr gals with get lower weights ?
	trainings on tw-1-snc-snr-above-10 are also running
	
	
- see if tp with sizes down to 0.5 is helpful, or much worse. Modify tp in accordance.
	Training e is running
	
	Start training shear once done with e and sims.


- see if retraining w for a few its after updating the predictions with final tp is better.



- see if a slightly better vo (with 2 times more data) makes plot look nicer (especially after the snrcut...)
	-	sim vo-2 is running (ec7)




- make fig that analyzses results on cuts

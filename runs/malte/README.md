- **meastest**: standalone tiny sim to test feature measurements (in particular aperphot) (spring 2016).
- **sbe**: code which led to the SBE "submissions", intended for personal use (not clean enough for sharing).
- **sdcsbe**: a single-script wrapper to run on SBE data, written to be run by an SDC in fall 2015, but without the sim and train parts, just predictions for now.
- **simple**: Run on simple simulations for machine learning development. No "Run"-Class, just hard-coded calls to megalut functions (2016), to make code development easy.

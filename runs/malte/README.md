- **sbe**: code which led to the SBE "submissions", intended for personal use (not clean enough for sharing).
- **sdcsbe**: a single-script wrapper to run on SBE data, written to be run by an SDC in fall 2015, but without the sim and train parts, just predictions for now.
- **simple**: see README.
- **meastest**: standalone tiny sim to test feature measurements (in particular aperphot) (spring 2016).
